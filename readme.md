# ML - PROJECT DISCUSSION
## 1. To Develop an accurate and reliable weather prediction model that takes into account multiple meteorological variables, historical weather data, and advanced machine learning algorithms to provide precise forecasts for various geographic locations and time horizons
## Dataset used :
[seattle-weather.csv](https://github.com/SANTHAN-2006/ML-PROJECT/files/15346849/seattle-weather.csv)

### Summary of the Design Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data, including feature extraction and normalization.
2. **Data Splitting:** Divide the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection:** Choose suitable algorithms for the prediction task.
4. **Model Training:** Train the chosen model on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Optimization:** Tune the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.
7. **Model Deployment:** Deploy the model to a production environment with an API for predictions.

## Design Procedure :
To enhance the process of building a weather prediction model as demonstrated in the provided code, we can outline seven key design steps. These steps will cover data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment. Here's a structured approach to improve the model and ensure robust weather predictions:

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

#### 1.1. Data Cleaning
- **Handle Missing Values:** Fill or drop missing values in the dataset.
- **Correct Data Types:** Ensure that numerical and categorical data are correctly typed.

#### 1.2. Feature Engineering
- **Date Features:** Extract meaningful features from the date column (e.g., month, season).
- **Normalization/Scaling:** Scale numerical features to ensure the model converges faster and performs better.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Fill missing values
weather_df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Extract date features
weather_df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']).dt.month
weather_df['day'] = pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']).dt.day

# Drop original date column
weather_df = weather_df.drop(columns=['date'])

# Normalize numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
numerical_features = ['precipitation', 'temp_max', 'temp_min', 'wind']
weather_df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(weather_df[numerical_features])
```

### Step 2: Data Splitting

- **Train-Test Split:** Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = weather_df.drop(columns=['weather'])
y = weather_df['weather']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=101)
```

### Step 3: Model Selection

- **Algorithm Choice:** Select appropriate machine learning algorithms. For classification tasks like weather prediction, consider trying multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=101)
```

### Step 4: Model Training

- **Train the Model:** Fit the model on the training data.

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 5: Model Evaluation

- **Evaluate Performance:** Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess the model.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

### Step 6: Model Optimization

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30]
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
```

### Step 7: Model Deployment (Optional - if we need to deploy it using API)

- **Deploy the Model:** Implement the model in a production environment, providing an API for real-time predictions.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    test_df = pd.DataFrame([data])
    test_df[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(test_df[numerical_features])
    prediction = best_model.predict(test_df)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
